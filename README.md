# Expense Tracker
###### -Santi Ochoa de Zabalegui

## Purpose:

This Swift app was made as a side project for me to practice my Swift programming skills and to learn the project with a real-life app that somebody could potentially use. 
It was inspired by a YouTube tutorial, with some UI changes, and different implementations of some views and functions, as well as a couple of extra features I thought would be nice to have.

## Features:

### Face ID/Touch ID app lock:

This app features a custom biometric lock in case the user wants to have a password and/or biometric access only to the expenses, made with some quality-of-life features such as 
automatically scanning Face ID, locking the app when it goes into the background, and changing the password and lock mode type.

### Adding expenses:

This app lets you add an expense, categorize it by expense or income, with a date and remarks, which the user can easily see on the home page, and edit with just a simple tap.

### Expense filtering and sorting:

This app also lets the user filter the expense by incomes, expenses, or all, and also select a date range to only show the expenses between 2 dates.
It also can sort the expenses by date or amount. 

### Chart View:

The app has a chart view, where the user can view all the expenses and income with a simple graph, which shows the different amount of income and expenses each month, with a list of
all of them right below, for easy access to the desired month.

### Search View:
